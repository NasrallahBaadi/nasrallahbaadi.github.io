# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [basic mission 2](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/2/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/)

# **Solution**

Let's navigate to the challenge page.

Sam didn't upload the password file, but the script will still work, it's going to take the password we supply and compare it to nothing, since it's not going to find the file. So we can just press the submit button and get in.


Thank you for taking the time to read my writeup, I hope you have learned something with this, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. See you in the next hack :) .
