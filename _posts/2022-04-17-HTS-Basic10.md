# **Solution**

Let's navigate to the challenge page.

Here, we have nothing to work with, but we know that Sam has used a hidden way to authenticate users, and it has something to do with **javascript**.

Let's check the cookies of the website, on firefox, press F12 and go to Storage.

Thers is a cookie named **level10_authorized** and has it's value set to **no**. Let's change the value to **yes**.

Now refresh the page, check the cookie again and you should be able to see that it is set to **yes**.

To pass the level, just submit a blank password.
