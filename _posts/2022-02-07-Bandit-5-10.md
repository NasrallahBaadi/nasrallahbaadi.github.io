# **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. In today's episode we will be doing Level 5 -> Level 10 of [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). Let's connect to **bandit5** and start.

# **Level 5 -> Level 6**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

 - human-readable
 - 1033 bytes in size
 - not executable

## **Solution**

With that information, we can use `find` with the following tags:
 - ./ : To start the search from the current directory.
 - -type f : To search for files.
 - -size 1033c : To look for files with the 1033 bytes in size


```terminal
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere02  maybehere04  maybehere06  maybehere08  maybehere10  maybehere12  maybehere14  maybehere16  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere03  maybehere05  maybehere07  maybehere09  maybehere11  maybehere13  maybehere15  maybehere17  maybehere19
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find ./ -type f -size 1033c
./maybehere07/.file2
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2

# **Level 6 -> Level 7**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

## **Solution**

We can use `find` to search for this file with the following tags.
 - / : Start the search in the root directory.
 - -type f : Search for files.
 - -user bandit7 : Files owned by user bandit7.
 - -group bandit6 : Files owned by group bandit6.
 - size 33c : Files with 33 bytes in size
 - 2>/dev/null : Send any errors to /dev/null
 ```terminal
 bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

 ```

# **Level 7 -> Level 8**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

## **Solution**

We can read the file with `cat` and pip it to `grep` that will search for the word 'millionth' in that output.

```terminal
bandit7@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4088
-rw-r----- 1 bandit8 bandit7 4184396 May  7  2020 data.txt
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep 'millionth'
millionth       cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9xxx
```

# **Level 8 -> Level 9**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

## **Solution**

In data.txt, every sentence is repeated more than once, except our password. We need to sort the content of the file and delete the duplicates in it, we can do that with `sort` and `uniq -u`.

```terminal
bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u

```

# **Level 9 -> Level 10**

## **Goal**

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

## **Solution**

We can print the only human-readable strings with the command `strings`, we can then pip the output to `grep` and look for **=** signs.

```terminal
bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep ==
========== the*2i"4
========== password
Z)========== is
