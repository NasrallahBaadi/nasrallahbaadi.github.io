## **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [basic mission 1](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/1/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/)

## **Solution**

Navigating to the challenge page we see the following:

![q](/assets/img/hackthissite/basic/bm1/level1.png)

We need to submit a password, let's check the source code of the page and see if we can find something, we can do that by pressing `ctrl`+`U` or by right click -> View Page Source.

We got the password, now copy it and submit it and let's move to level 2.

The reason behind this challenge is that sometimes, developers put notes, hidden pages for the Webapp or even usernames and password as html comments while they develop the Webapp, and they forget to remove them after they finish, so it's worth checking the source code.



Thank you for taking the time to read my writeup, I hope you have learned something with this, if you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. See you in the next hack :) .
