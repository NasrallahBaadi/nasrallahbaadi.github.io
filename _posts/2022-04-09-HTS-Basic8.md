## **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We will be doing [Basic mission 8](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/8/) from [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/).

## **Solution**

Let's navigate to the challenge page.

An unencrypted password file is still there, now we have a program that saves user input into a file, let's submit a **name** to see what the program does.

We get redirected to this page that tells us to click a link to view the file. Let's click the link.

It says Hi, prints the name we submitted and tells us how many characters the name has. One other thing to notice is the URL : https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/8/tmp/ubjvgnow.shtml. The file has a random string and a `.shtml` as an extension. I googled `shtml exploit` and found that it is famously vulnerable to SSI Injection. I found this [article](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server-Side_Includes_(SSI)_Injection) that explains how the vulnerability works. In the article i found a payload that would let us list the content of the directory: `<!--#exec cmd="ls" -->`, let's submit that as a name and see.

We managed to list the content of /tmp directory, we know that the password is up a directory, so let's run `ls ..` to see the content of /8 directory, the final payload will look like this `<!--#exec cmd="ls .." -->`

Great! We listed the content of the challenge directory and we found the password file, navigate to that file to get the password.
