## **Description**

Hello l33ts, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [OverPass 2 - Hacked](https://tryhackme.com/room/overpass2hacked) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), it's a medium machine where we are given a pcap file to analyze that contains packets captured during an attack, let's download the file and open it with wireshark.

## **Forensics - PCAP Analysis**

When we open the pcap file with wireshark, we see a **GET** request for **/development** page.

![dev](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/overpassdev.png)

The attacker used this page to upload a php reverse shell.

![up](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/overup.png)

We need to follow the tcp stream of the POST request packet to see more information, we can do that by right clicking the POST packet > follow > tcp stream

![payload](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/overpay.png)

With that, we can see what payload the attacker has used to get a reverse shell.

Looking trought the packets, we see that a new tcp connection is being established right after the attacker has uploaded the php payload.

![syn](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/syn.png)

Let's follow the tcp stream of the 29th packet.

![shell](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/shell.png)

We can see what the attacker has executed after gaining a shell, we see that he changed user to james using james's password. Scrolling down, we see that the attacker cloned a repository from github.

![backdoor](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/backdoor.png)

we can also see hashes of deferent users.

![hashes](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/shadow.png)

## **Research - Code Analysis**

Let's navigate to the ssh-backdoor repository on github https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor

Click **main.go** to see the source code.

![code](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/code.png)

We can see the default hash for the backdoor.

If you scroll down to the bottom of the file we can see the hardcoded salt for the backdoor.

![salt](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/hash.png)

Returning to the pcap file where the attacker got into the machine, we can see the hash he used for the backdoor.

![back](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/backhash.png)

Using `hash-identifier`, we see that the hash is **sha512**

We can now copy that hash and add the salt we found earlier to it and try to crack it. the final string will look like this.

![str](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/crack.png)

I will be using `hashcat` to crack the password, but we need to find the mode to use for sha512 hash.

![mode](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/cat.png)

The mode we'll use is 1710, the final command will look like this : `hashcat -m 1710 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`


## **Attack - Get back in!**

Visiting the webpage, we see that the attacker has changed the face of the website.

![page](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/webpage.png)

Let's now try to get if we look at one of the packets of the pcap file, we can see that the attacker started SSH backdoor on port 2222.

![port](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/port.png)

We are provided with a hint that tells us that the backdoor only checks the password, so we can only specify the host and the port, provide the password we cracked and get in.

![ssh](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/ssh.png)

We are in, let's see if we can get root.

![root](/assets/img/tryhackme/overpass/root.png)

We moved to james home directory and see that the attacker made a copy of bash owned by root and gave it **suid** permission, we are able to execute it as root and get root privileges.
